# UX

## Introduction of Product

This is a simulated world where users are allow to observe the ongoing events and interact with the characters.

## User Interaction

We have to limit the interaction from user interfering the world too much. Like I don't want to see some HR folks to teach the HR characters to hire PhD only to hire the best, keep the bar high, and strive the be the best employer. Eventually all the young characters will end up depressed in their fixed academic path.

I will allow all characters to use an social app, lets call it "One Thread". Characters will update everything including diary, public social posts, private social posts... on the app. All the posts in One Thread are visible to the users(sorry my babies), but only **reply/like** on the public once, unless they become friends of the character. Interaction on the public thread will have slightly impact to the characters.

User are also allow to send **direct message** to the characters, and **Support** them like friends do, every **user can Support up to 2 times a day**(real world time). Support can impact the characters base very differently. For example, Character Jennie wants to draw a landscape today, you can support her by being part of it. The would won't change much just because of that, but Jennie might share her story with you in today's diary. And I do hope that Jennie will change her goal to chase me one day. Another example can be, Dave is a college student who wants to buy a cacino and you would like to help. So, you buy him a bucket and a brush to wash some cars with him, earned 40 bucks in 4 hour and back from cacino after another 10 minutes.
