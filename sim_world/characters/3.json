Surrounded by snow-themed artwork, he felt inspired to express these emotions through his own designs, seeing how the artists captured the essence of winter in different mediums. 'Can you feel the chill in this piece?' he asked the artist, who nodded and smiled. The warmth inside the gallery and the sharing of ideas continued to fuel his passion for art."
