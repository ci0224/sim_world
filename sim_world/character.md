# Character

I want each character to have their own personality. I plan to add as many dimensions of a person as possible, allowing LLM to simulate their behavior accordingly.

## Dimension of Character

1. 16 personalities
2. ZodiacSign
3. History of mental illness
4. Age, Gender, Sexual Orientation
5. Education Level
6. ...

## More than fixed, pre-programmed dimensions, Character must have Memories

Based on the dimensions above, we should be able to generate thousands of very different characters. However, people grows, not merely their the education level or salaries, but in every direction.

**Storing memories** and use them to drive the characters. Human has memories, leasons, knowledge and past events, and all of them lead us to make different combination of choices and make us who we are today. Remember everything is impossible for human, and from the perspective of context of LLM, it is also challenging because there will be too much information. So we need to a way to clean up the less significant memory so that it does not infinitely expand, just like real persons.

**Forgetting Mechanism** of real human are somehow random, we said we only remember the most important things, but we also forget important things somehow. Human memories are not like computer memories, we don't forget things relying on Least Number of Retrival, or Oldest Accessed. Character's Forgetting Mechanism will be completely independent like real human, and has some random cases to forget things.

## Behavior Guidence of Character

Behavior Guidence act as the reasoning behind the behaviors of characters. We do things that we have to do everyday, like cigerate after work, like working 12 hours 6 days to buy a 700 sqft apartment in Shanghai. Everyone has a Hero in  mind, and we want to be like them. We pretent like we are betman but we are in fact not just poor, but also weak inside.

So, character's behaviors will be guided according to...

1. Dimensions
2. Favorite Character from novel,
3. Long term goals, short term goals, and objective of the day
4. Memories
